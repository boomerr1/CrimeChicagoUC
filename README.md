# CrimePredictionChicago
A machine learning model to predict criminal activity in the city Chicago.

Data:

[Chicago crime data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-One-year-prior-to-present/x2n5-8w5q/data)

Roadmap:
- [ ] Recreate the model for crime prediction in Chicago
- [ ] Add and preprocess only a subset (most important) data
    - [ ] Align sattelite image with shapefile
- [ ] Evaluate the model
- [ ] Add more data that might improve accuracy
